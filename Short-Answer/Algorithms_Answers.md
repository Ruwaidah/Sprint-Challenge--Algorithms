#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) on loop


b) O(n^2)


c) O(n)

## Exercise II
    n = number of floors floors
    f = number of floors with eggs break

    determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized

    I will start from the middle floor of the building then see If I need to go up or down to find the f floor  then I will need one loop to to find out when the egg will stop break.
    the run time complexity is O(n)
